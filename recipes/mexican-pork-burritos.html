    <p>
        We love these pork burritos! I tweaked my Aunt Pennie's original recipe, and now I always make this when friends come
        over for dinner. <br>I can usually get about 20 to 24 burritos from one batch of filling. Serve them with lettuce, tomatoes,
        green onions, sour cream, salsa, avocados, black olives, and more Cheddar cheese.

    <ol>
        <li>
            Place pork roast, onion, and garlic into a large pot. Sprinkle one package taco seasoning over top and add enough water
            to cover roast. <br>Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until meat is
            tender and can be pulled apart with a fork, 2 to 3 hours. <br>Check water level every 45 minutes, adding more as needed.
            Carefully transfer roast to a cutting board. Discard vegetables, but reserve about 1 cup cooking liquid.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Shred pork with a fork, discarding any excess fat. Place pork into a mixing bowl with refried beans, tomatoes, refried
            beans, chiles, and remaining taco seasoning. <br>Mix until well combined, adding reserved cooking liquid if mixture is too
            dry.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Spread pork mixture evenly down the center of each tortilla, then sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. <br>Fold the bottom and top
            edges of each tortilla over the filling, then roll from one side to form a burrito.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place two burritos into the hot oil with the seams facing
            down. <br>Fry until golden, about 2 minutes. flip and repeat on the other side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. <br>Continue
            to fry remaining burritos in batches of two.
        </li>
    </ol>
